# üñº Snapscribe - AI Image Caption Generator

## üåü About the Project
The **Snapscribe** is an AI-powered web app that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images. Using state-of-the-art deep learning models, the application analyzes an image and produces meaningful captions that describe its content. This tool is useful for accessibility, content creation, and even search engine optimization (SEO).

## üî• Features
- Upload an image and receive a **detailed, AI-generated caption**.
- Uses the **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)** model for high-quality captions.
- **User-friendly interface** with a modern design and smooth experience.
- Deployed using **Gradio**, making it easy to interact with the model.
- **Attractive UI** with a visually appealing gradient background.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python** üêç ‚Äì Core programming language for implementing the model.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** ü§ó ‚Äì Used for loading and running the BLIP model.
- **Torch (PyTorch)** üî• ‚Äì Deep learning framework for processing image inputs.
- **PIL (Pillow)** üñº ‚Äì Image processing library for handling image input.
- **Gradio** üé® ‚Äì Web framework for building and hosting the interactive UI.
- **CSS** üé® ‚Äì Custom styling for an aesthetically pleasing experience.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. The user uploads an image.
2. The BLIP model processes the image and generates a textual description.
3. The generated caption is displayed on the web interface.
4. Users can download or use the caption as needed.
